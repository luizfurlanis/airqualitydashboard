# Road Accident Dashboar 
> _It is a dashbord made with [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), a web apps creator for data science.

##About 

The main purpose of this project was to learn how to manipulate data, create dashboards with leaflet and in addition to show a problem that have big importance in the society context. This application in only showing **fatal** accidents, if we consider **non fatal** accidents the number of occurrences would have been enormous.

###Data

The Australian Road Deaths Database provides basic details of road transport crash fatalities in Australia as reported by the police year to the State and Territory road safety authorities. Road deaths from recent months are preliminary and the series is subject to revision. 

The dataset that was used in this project is available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) website, they have different datasets of all niches. I used the [Australian Fatal Road Accident](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/australian-fatal-car-accident-data-19892021), but they have many others car crash datasets.
